    "# Philips Hue Light Notification Alarm\n",
    "\n",
    "My project is a light notification alarm. The script opens a menu where the user can **set an alarm**, along **with a corresponding light color**. When it's time for the alarm to go off, it turns the light on to the specific choosen color, which **stays on until the user turns it off**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **script and modules utilize the Philips Hue API**, using a **Philips Hue white and color smart bulb** and a **Philips bridge**. \n",
    "\n",
    "All **smart bulbs need to connect to a bridge** to access their \"smart\" capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background:\n",
    "The inspiration for this project came from my tendency to forget about my alarms after turning them off. I set a lot of alarms throughout the day to keep myself on track, but I turn them off immediately when they start ringing because they can be noisy and disturbing. I usually end up forgetting about them for hours and end up not following through on whatever it was I set the alarm for. Using a colored light instead of a sound would allow me leave the alarm on until I complete the intended task. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes About the API, related to Project Submission:\n",
    "- In order to use the Philips Hue API to send commands to the lights, the **bridge creates an IP address** that is then **used to create an API key**. \n",
    "    - **Both** the bridge's IP address and the API key are **needed to make the API call**. \n",
    "- The bridge can only receive http requests from inside our network, so the **code will only run properly inside our home network**.\n",
    "    - To remedy this, **I'm commenting out my API call** and **setting a print statement instead**. \n",
    "    - The **master I upload to GitHub will be the correct version** that runs the code properly from my home computer.\n",
    "    - I'll also upload my **project submission copy as a branch** of my master on GitHub (**inal-Modified**)\n",
    "    - I'll also include a **video to demonstrate** my code working with **my lights in my room**. \n",
    "- For security purposes, the **copies I upload to GitHub will not have my API credentials**. I saved the actual bridge IP address and API key to variables in a separate, hidden module (called secret). I will not be uploading that file to GitHub, but maybe I'll upload an example file, for reference.\n",
